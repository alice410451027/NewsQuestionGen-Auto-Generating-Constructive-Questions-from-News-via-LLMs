🎯 Task Goal
This project builds an automated pipeline that:
•	Loads and processes a dataset of 408 news articles
•	Batches them into groups of 15
•	Uses Gemini and Groq's LLM APIs to generate meaningful questions for each article
•	Handles error logging, delays, and API responses
•	Outputs the results into both CSV and JSONL formats

⚙️ Methodology
•	Data Source: News articles in .jsonl format with fields like title, content, and url
•	Preprocessing: Clean and extract relevant article text
•	Prompt Engineering: Design prompts that ensure questions are constructive, non-yes/no, and grounded in the article
•	LLM Integration:
o	Originally used Gemini Pro (Google)
o	Switched to Groq API with LLaMA 3 70B model for faster, efficient generation
•	Batch & Delay:
o	Process 15 articles per batch
o	Insert 60s delay between batches to respect rate limits
•	Error Handling:
o	Catch and log API errors (e.g., deprecation, model access, format issues)
o	Fallback structure to avoid interruption
•	Output:
o	Combined result saved as news_with_questions_all.csv and news_with_questions_all.jsonl

✅ Results
•	Successfully processed 408 news articles
•	Generated a diverse and constructive set of questions
•	Achieved high API response accuracy and batch reliability
•	Outputs structured and accessible for downstream analysis or use

📌 Applications
•	👩🏫 Education: Reading comprehension, news literacy programs
•	🧪 NLP Research: Q&A dataset generation, question quality analysis
•	🔍 Media Analysis: Studying how AI generates inquiries based on media
•	🤖 AI Development: Can be fine-tuned for intelligent tutoring or news summarization tasks
